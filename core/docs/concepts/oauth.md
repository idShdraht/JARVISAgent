# OAuth

JARVIS supports “subscription auth” via OAuth for providers that offer it (notably **OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT OAuth)**). For Anthropic subscriptions, use the **setup-token** flow. This page explains:

- how the OAuth **token exchange** works (PKCE)
- where tokens are **stored** (and why)
- how to handle **multiple accounts** (profiles + per-session overrides)

JARVIS also supports **provider plugins** that ship their own OAuth or API‑key
flows. Run them via:

```bash
jarvis models auth login --provider <id>
```

## The token sink (why it exists)

OAuth providers commonly mint a **new refresh token** during login/refresh flows. Some providers (or OAuth clients) can invalidate older refresh tokens when a new one is issued for the same user/app.

Practical symptom:

- you log in via JARVIS _and_ via Claude Code / Codex CLI → one of them randomly gets “logged out” later

To reduce that, JARVIS treats `auth-profiles.json` as a **token sink**:

- the runtime reads credentials from **one place**
- we can keep multiple profiles and route them deterministically

## Storage (where tokens live)

Secrets are stored **per-agent**:

- Auth profiles (OAuth + API keys + optional value-level refs): `~/.jarvis/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- Legacy compatibility file: `~/.jarvis/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth.json`
  (static `api_key` entries are scrubbed when discovered)

Legacy import-only file (still supported, but not the main store):

- `~/.jarvis/credentials/oauth.json` (imported into `auth-profiles.json` on first use)

All of the above also respect `$JARVIS_STATE_DIR` (state dir override). Full reference: [/gateway/configuration](/gateway/configuration#auth-storage-oauth--api-keys)

For static secret refs and runtime snapshot activation behavior, see [Secrets Management](/gateway/secrets).

## Anthropic setup-token (subscription auth)

Run `claude setup-token` on any machine, then paste it into JARVIS:

```bash
jarvis models auth setup-token --provider anthropic
```

If you generated the token elsewhere, paste it manually:

```bash
jarvis models auth paste-token --provider anthropic
```

Verify:

```bash
jarvis models status
```

## OAuth exchange (how login works)

JARVIS’s interactive login flows are implemented in `@mariozechner/pi-ai` and wired into the wizards/commands.

### Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max) setup-token

Flow shape:

1. run `claude setup-token`
2. paste the token into JARVIS
3. store as a token auth profile (no refresh)

The wizard path is `jarvis onboard` → auth choice `setup-token` (Anthropic).

### OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT OAuth)

Flow shape (PKCE):

1. generate PKCE verifier/challenge + random `state`
2. open `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/authorize?...`
3. try to capture callback on `http://127.0.0.1:1455/auth/callback`
4. if callback can’t bind (or you’re remote/headless), paste the redirect URL/code
5. exchange at `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token`
6. extract `accountId` from the access token and store `{ access, refresh, expires, accountId }`

Wizard path is `jarvis onboard` → auth choice `openai-codex`.

## Refresh + expiry

Profiles store an `expires` timestamp.

At runtime:

- if `expires` is in the future → use the stored access token
- if expired → refresh (under a file lock) and overwrite the stored credentials

The refresh flow is automatic; you generally don't need to manage tokens manually.

## Multiple accounts (profiles) + routing

Two patterns:

### 1) Preferred: separate agents

If you want “personal” and “work” to never interact, use isolated agents (separate sessions + credentials + workspace):

```bash
jarvis agents add work
jarvis agents add personal
```

Then configure auth per-agent (wizard) and route chats to the right agent.

### 2) Advanced: multiple profiles in one agent

`auth-profiles.json` supports multiple profile IDs for the same provider.

Pick which profile is used:

- globally via config ordering (`auth.order`)
- per-session via `/model ...@<profileId>`

Example (session override):

- `/model Opus@anthropic:work`

How to see what profile IDs exist:

- `jarvis channels list --json` (shows `auth[]`)
